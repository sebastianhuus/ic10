# ic10
A collection of IC10 scripts I have made in the game Stationeers. IC10 runs on a MIPS-like assembly language.

You might want to install the [IC10 VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Traineratwot.stationeers-ic10) if you want to read and code your own scripts.
