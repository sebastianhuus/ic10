# ic10
A collection of IC10 scripts I have made in the game Stationeers. IC10 runs on a MIPS-like assembly language.

You might want to install the [IC10 VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Traineratwot.stationeers-ic10) if you want to read and code your own scripts.

Current collection:
- Door Controller is a two-chip script that manages an airlock. One chip is used for managing signals from logic buttons, while the other manages the airlock ventilation cycling and the doors. It is  compatible with all electronic doors.
